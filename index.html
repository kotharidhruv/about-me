    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Hello, my name is Dhruv Kothari. I'm currently a freshman in highschool with an interest in being an engineer in the aerospace field. I plan on achieving 
        this goal by taking high svhool and college courses which deepen my understanding on things that apply to aerospace. For example, computer science is a
        vital aspect of not just aerospace, but engineering in general. The reason I choose to pursue aerospace is because it involves my love of two things; 
        coding and space. From a young age, I have always loved learning about the wonders of space. As I've grown up, I've discovered how I can make almost 
        anything using code.
